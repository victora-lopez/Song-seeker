# Song-seeker

I've ran into a frequent problem in my life where I find a song that I enjoy deeply and resonates with me, but struggle to find songs that are similar to it. All the song recommendation apps create a playlist based on your holisitic music listening experience, and while it not being a bad idea, I believe having an app that is tailored for finding songs that are similar to one specific song would be nice especially if I am looking for a particular vibe/sound.

Which is why I am creating this web app in React that can give recommendations for a specific song using Spotify APIs.
